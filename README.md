# Project
This code builds a movie recommendation system using two methods: content-based filtering (using movie genres with TF-IDF and cosine similarity) and collaborative filtering (using user ratings with KNN). It loads movie and rating data, defines recommendation functions, and creates a Streamlit app for user interaction.
